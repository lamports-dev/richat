# richat

Next iteration of [Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth / Geyser gRPC](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc) that was originally developed and currently maintained by [Triton One](https://triton.one/). `Richat` includes code derived from `Dragon's Mouth` (copyright `Triton One Limited`) with significant architecture changes.

In addition to `Yellowstone Drangon's Mouth / Geyser gRPC` richat includes Solana PubSub implementation.

## Components

- `cli` — CLI client for full stream, gRPC stream with filters, simple Solana PubSub
- `client` — library for building consumers
- `filter` — library for filtering geyser messages
- `plugin-agave` — Agave validator geyser plugin https://docs.anza.xyz/validator/geyser
- `proto` — library with proto files, re-imports structs from crate `yellowstone-grpc-proto`
- `richat` — app with full stream consumer and producers: gRPC (`Dragon's Mouth`), Solana PubSub
- `shared` — shared code between components (except `client`)

## Releases

#### Branches

- `master` — development branch
- `agave-v2.0` — development branch for agave v2.0
- `agave-v2.1` — development branch for agave v2.1
- `agave-v2.2` — development branch for agave v2.2

#### Tags

- `cli-v0.0.0`
- `client-v0.0.0`
- `filter-v0.0.0`
- `plugin-agave-v0.0.0`
- `plugin-agave-v0.0.0+solana.2.1.5`
- `proto-v0.0.0`
- `richat-v0.0.0`
- `shared-v0.0.0`

At one moment of time we can support more than one agave version (like v2.0 and v2.1), as result we can have two different major supported versions of every component, for example: `cli-v1.y.z` for `agave-v2.0` and `cli-v2.y.z` for `agave-v2.1`. In addition to standard version, `plugin-agave` can have one or more tags with pinned solana version.
